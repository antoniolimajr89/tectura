=== Bootstrapping

To bootstrap the project, you'll need to define database and email settings in the files:

	1. <tt>config/database.yml</tt>
	2. <tt>config/email.yml</tt> 

Then, execute the following commands on the project root:

<tt>rake gems:install</tt>

<tt>rake app:bootstrap</tt>

You may be prompted to install a few extra gems.
